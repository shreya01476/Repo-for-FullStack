    <p style="text-align: left; color: dimgray; font-size: medium; font-weight: lighter; font-style: italic;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">One of the most mystifying things that can happen in your garden is when a plant gets a disease. How did it happen? Will it spread? Will all my plants die? How can I get rid of it? The most important thing to understand about disease prevention is something called the disease triangle (drawing, right). Disease can only happen when three things coincide: you have a plant that can get sick (a host), a pathogen (like a fungus, bacterium, or virus) that can attack the plant, and environmental conditions (like humidity or drought) that promote the disease. If any one of these things is not present, the disease will not happen, so prevention involves knocking out at least one side of the triangle. Rather than waiting for a problem to pop up in your garden, consider the best defense against disease to be a good offense. What follows are 10 ways you can eliminate at least one side of the disease triangle and keep your plants healthy.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left; color: dimgray; font-size: medium; font-weight: lighter; font-style: italic; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The easiest way to limit disease in your garden is to avoid introducing it in the first place. Getting a disease with a new plant is not the kind of bonus that any of us wants. One of the hardest things to learn is what a healthy plant should look like, making it difficult to know if the one you want is sick.

        It is a good idea to collect a few books, magazines, and catalogs that show what a healthy specimen looks like. Don’t take home a plant with dead spots, rotted stems, or insects. These problems can easily spread to your healthy plants and are sometimes hard to get rid of once established.
        
        In addition to checking the tops of plants, always inspect the root quality. One does not often see customers doing this in a garden center, but it should be a common sight. Place your hand on the soil surface with the plant stem between your fingers. Gently invert the pot and shake the plant loose. You may have to tap the edge of the pot against a solid surface to loosen the roots from the pot. Roots should be firm, usually white, and spaced all over the root-ball. Dark or mushy roots are not a good sign. Even when the tops appear healthy, it’s just a matter of time before a rotted root system kills a plant.</p>

    <img src="./images/composting-yard-waste.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 200px;">
    <p style="text-align: left; color: dimgray; font-size: medium; font-weight: lighter; font-style: italic; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" >Not all materials in a compost pile decompose at the same rate. Some materials may have degraded sufficiently to be put in the garden, while others have not. Thorough composting generates high temperatures for extended lengths of time, which actually kill any pathogens in the material. Infected plant debris that has not undergone this process will reintroduce potential diseases into your garden. If you are not sure of the conditions of your compost pile, you should avoid using yard waste as mulch under sensitive plants and avoid including possibly infected debris in your pile.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left; color: dimgray; font-size: medium;font-weight: lighter; font-style: italic; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"> Insect damage to plants is much more than cos­metic. Viruses and bacteria often can only enter a plant through some sort of opening, and bug damage provides that. Some insects actually act as a transport for viruses, spreading them from one plant to the next. Aphids are one of the most common carriers, and thrips spread impatiens necrotic spot virus, which has become a serious problem for commercial producers over the past 10 years. Aster yellows (photo, right) is a disease carried by leaf­hoppers and has a huge range of host plants. Insect attacks are another way to put a plant under stress, rendering it less likely to fend off disease.</p>

    <img src="./images/toprotectpol.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 500px;">
    <p style="text-align:left; color: dimgray;font-size: medium;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-weight: lighter; font-style: italic;">It is always best to clean out the garden in the fall, even if you live in a moderate climate. This is not only an effective deterrent to disease but also a good way to control diseases already in your garden  can overwinter on dead leaves and debris and attack the new leaves as they emerge in spring. Iris leaf spot, daylily leaf streak, and black spot on roses are examples of diseases that can be dramatically reduced if the dead leaves are cleared away each fall. If you are leaving stems and foliage to create winter interest, be sure to remove them before new growth starts in spring.</p>

   <li> <h3 style="color:brown ; text-align: left; font-size: larger;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-weight: normal;">Choose disease-resistant plants:</h3></li>
    <img src="./images/images.jpg" style="width: 500px; height:200px;">
    <p style="color: dimgray;text-align: left;font-size: medium;font-weight: lighter;font-style: italic;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">These plant varieties have a defense mechanism against the attacks of insects and diseases. Some plants can survive a pest problem by growing out a new root or shoot. Others produce chemicals that reduce insect feeding.

        For example, there are tomato varieties that are resistant to “VFN,” which means they can fight off damage caused by fungi (e.g. Verticillium and Fusarium) and nematodes.
        
        Garden designers and tree nursery staff can assist you in identifying disease-resistant plants. You can also refer to gardening books that may have a list of plants that have resistance to specific insects and diseases.</p>

For instance, azaleas grow well in shaded areas. Plant it in a sunny zone and it will become susceptible to insects and diseases.

            Plants also have an immune system that kicks into high gear when they are put under unfavourable conditions. When stressed out, plants are not able to fight off or recover from infections.</p>
