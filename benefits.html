    <h1 style="color:goldenrod;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;font-weight: bolder;font-style: oblique; text-align:center;">Health Benefits of gardening:</h1>
    <p style="color: dimgray;font-size: medium;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-weight: normal;">Planting flowers and vegetables can reap bountiful bouquets and delicious harvests for your dining table. But did you know gardening also can do wonders for your well-being? Here are surprising health benefits of gardening.</p>
    <h3 style="color: brown;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;font-size:x-large;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;" > Gardening can build self-esteem:</h3>
    <p style="color: dimgray;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-size: medium;font-weight: normal; text-align: left;">Maybe you don’t think you were born with a green thumb, but after tilling, planting, nurturing and harvesting plants, you might see a slightly different person in the mirror: a person who can grow things and is a little more in tune with the earth. 

        It always feels good to accomplish new tasks, and if you can grow a garden, what can’t you do?</p>
        <h3 style="color: brown;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;font-size: x-large;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;">Gardening is good for your heart:</h3>

        <p style="text-align: left; color: dimgray;font-size: medium;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">All that digging, planting and weeding burns calories and strengthens your heart. <br/>

            “There are physical benefits from doing the manual labor of gardening,” says UNC Health internal medicine physician Robert Hutchins, MD, MPH. “It’s hard work to garden, and it provides some cardiovascular benefit.”</p>
            <h3 style="color:brown;font-size: x-large;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;text-align: left;">Gardening can improve your hand strength:</h3>
            <p style="color: dimgray; text-align: left;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-size: medium;font-weight: normal;">All that digging, planting and pulling does more than produce plants. Gardening also will increase your hand strength. What a great way to keep your hands and fingers as strong as possible for as long as possible.</p>
            <h3 style="color: brown;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;font-size: x-large;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;">Gardening can give you a boost of vitamin D:</h3>
<p style="color: dimgray;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-size: medium;font-weight: normal; text-align: left;">A healthy dose of vitamin D increases your calcium levels, which benefits your bones and immune system. Exposure to sunlight helped older adults achieve adequate amounts of vitamin D. Just don’t forget your sunscreen.</p>
<h3 style="color: brown;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;font-size: x-large;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;"> Gardening can make you happy:</h3>
<p style="color: dimgray;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-size: medium;font-weight: normal; text-align: left;">Getting dirt under your nails while digging in the ground can make you pretty happy. In fact, inhaling M. vaccae, a healthy bacteria that lives in soil, can increase levels of serotonin and reduce anxiety. </p>
<h3 style="color: brown;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;font-size: x-large;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;">Gardening reduces stress:</h3>
<p style="color: dimgray;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-size: medium;font-weight: normal; text-align: left;">Gardening can help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. <br/>

    “Gardening gives you a chance to focus on something and put your mind to work with a goal and a task in mind,” Dr. Hutchins says, “which is helpful especially now with so much illness and death and talk of death, just to see things growing and things thriving.” </p>
